    \begin{itemize}
        \item A differential equation is an equation that related one or more unknown functions and their derivatives.
        \item In applications, the functions generally represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rate of changes, and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two.
        \item Two major division of differential equations: ODE and PDE.
